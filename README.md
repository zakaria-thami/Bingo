Solution of The Bingo challenge from Interview puzzles GitHub repository. Implemented with an observer/subscriber pattern

Although the solution is in python but i believe i avoided the use of pre built functions as much as possible making the code strcuture compatible with low level languages

## assignment - 1 
To guarantee victory against your grandma, figure out which board will win first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?


## assignment - 2

On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let your grandma win.

You arenâ€™t sure how many bingo boards an old lady can play at once, so the safe thing to do is to figure out which board will win last and choose that one. That way, no matter which boards she picks, she will win for sure.

In the above example, the second board is the last to win, which happens after 13 is eventually called and its middle column is completely marked. If you were to keep playing until this point, the second board would have a sum of unmarked numbers equal to 148 for a final score of 148 * 13 = 1924.

Figure out which board will win last. Once it wins, what would its final score be?

## Development Steps in Abstract 
  - step one: read inputs
  - step two: parse from string to list of integers
  - step three: classes design 
  - step four: code commenting
  - step five: output cleaning
